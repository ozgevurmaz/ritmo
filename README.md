# Ritmo – Habit & Goal Tracker App
Ritmo is a habit and goal tracking app built for people who want to grow intentionally, build better habits, and share their journey with others. It helps users turn goals into actionable habits, track progress, and stay motivated with a clean, gamified experience.

## What Problem Does Ritmo Solve?
- Most habit trackers treat goals and habits as isolated tasks. Ritmo connects them.
- It lets you create goals with a clear motivation, time range, and related habits.
- You can track your habits daily, see your progress, and reflect on your consistency.
- You’ll soon be able to collaborate with friends, build streaks together, and join community challenges.
